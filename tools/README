= Social QML plugin Facebook tools =

This set of tools, written in Python, are used to make generation of C++ interfaces easier.
Instead of writing boilerplate code, a set of scripts parse a JSON formatted file that describes
a Facebook interface, and write C++ code accordingly.

== JSON description file format ==

All JSON description files follow that scheme:

{
    "name": "my_interface",
    "doc": "Some documentation",
    "identifiable": false,
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "id",
            "type": "QString",
            "doc": "Some documentation for the id"
        },
        {
            "name": "specific_object",
            "is_pointer": true,
            "type": "MySpecificObject",
            "doc": "Some documentation for the specific object"
        },
        {
            "name": "property_outside_of_fb_api",
            "type": "int",
            "custom": true
            "doc": "Some documentation for that property that is not described in Facebook API"
        }
    ],
    "methods": [
        {
            "name": "simpleMethod",
            "parameters": [],
            "doc": "Some documentation"
        },
        {
            "name": "complexMethod",
            "parameters": [
                {
                    "type": "QString",
                    "name": "message",
                    "is_const": true,
                    "is_reference": true,
                    "default": "QString::number(23)"
                }
            ],
            "doc": "A very complex method call"
        }
    ]
}

The structure is basically splitted into three main categories:
* Description of the interface
* Description of the properties
* Description of the methods

Please note that all names that comes from Facebook API, that includes the
name of the interface and the name of the properties should be _ separated.
The name of methods should be written camelcased, since they are only used in
a Qt context.

=== Interface description ===

The interface is described with the top-level fields, and the properties and
methods are passed as lists for the "properties" and "methods" field.

==== Mandatory fields ====

* name (string)
    This field will be the name of the interface, and will be converted to camelcased.
* doc (string)
    This field should provide the documentation of the generated class.
    The \qmltype and \instantiates lines are automatically generated.
* identifiable (boolean)
    This field tells if the generated interface is an identifiable interface,
    meaning that if it derives from IdentifiableContentItemInterface or simply from 
    ContentItemInterface.

    Identifiable interfaces represents the main Facebook entities, that are described
    in the Graph API, whereas non-identifiable ones are structures that carry information
    (like the Cover for a Facebook user) but that do not have connections.

==== Optionnal fields ====

* extra_public (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the header, with a public scope.
    Additionnal enumerations and methods can be declared in that field.

* extra_protected (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the header, with a protected scope.
    
* extra_private (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the header, with a private scope.
    
* extra_public_p (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the private header, with a public scope.
    Additionnal attributes can be declared in that field.
    
* extra_protected_p (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the private header, with a protected scope.
    
* extra_private_p (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the private header, with a private scope.
    
* extra_source (string)
    This field contains code that should be added in the source code. It often contains
    implementation of methods declared with extra_public, extra_protected or extra_private.
    
=== Properties description ===

The properties description is a list of objects that should be passed to the "properties"
field. Each of these objects describes one property, that should be exposed by the graph API,
and be available in the QML context.

==== Mandatory fields ====

* name (string)
    This field will be the name of the property, and will be converted to camelcased.
* type (string)
    This field contains the type of the property. If the type is a reference, a pointer
    or is constant, do not mention it in this field. Instead, set the optionnal fields
    that corresponds to true.
* doc (string)
    This field should provide the documentation of the property.
    The \qmlproperty line is automatically generated.

==== Optionnal fields ====

* is_const (boolean)
    Tells that the property is a constant. 
* is_pointer (boolean)
    Tells that the property is a pointer. 
* is_reference (boolean)
    Tells that the property is a reference. 
* is_list (boolean)
    Tells that the property is a list.
    If a property is a list, the provided type must be a class deriving from ContentItemInterface,
    and all the other modifiers (is_pointer, is_const or is_reference) must be turned off.
* custom (boolean)
    Tells that this property should be handled specifically. The default properties are
    read directly from the data retrived from the Facebook graph API. However, some specific 
    properties, for example properties that are, in fact, enumerations, should be handled 
    specifically. By setting this field to true, a private attribute is created, and can be set 
    in emitPropertyChangeSignals.
    
    The accessor will always return that attribute instead of reading it from data from the Facebook
    graph API.
    
    Note that if is_pointer or is_list is set to true, custom is automatically set to true as well.
* is_ontology (boolean)
    Ontology keys are macros that corresponds to the name of the property in the Facebook graph
    API. If you define a property that do not exist in the Facebook graph API, you should disable
    the key that is automatically generated and associated to it, by setting this field to false.
    
=== Methods description ===

The properties description is a list of objects that should be passed to the "methods"
field. Each of these objects describes one method, that is a Q_INVOKABLE C++ method, that
returns a boolean, that indicates the state of the call.

==== Mandatory fields ====

* name (string)
    This field will be the name of the method. It is not camelcased.
* doc (string)
    This field should provide the documentation of the method.
    The \qmlmethod line is automatically generated.
* parameters (list of objects)
    This field contains the parmeters that the method takes. Each parameter have these fields:
    * name, that is the name of the parameter.
    * type, that is the type of the parameter. Like with property, there are modifiers to set it
      as a constant, a pointer or a reference.
    * is_const, is_pointer, is_reference, the type modifiers. (optionnal)
    * default, the default value of the parameter. (optionnal)
    
== Using the generators ==

=== The minipatcher system ===

All the generators use a small python library, called minipatcher. Minipatcher is heavily inspired
from the patching system using in spectacle to generate spec files. In order to allow completion of
information without loosing other information, minipatcher uses a set of flags to set regions where
the code should be kept.

The flags have this format

// <<< sometag
Code
More code
// >>> sometag

Inside the flags, the code will be kept, even if the tools are regenerated, but outside the flags,
any modification will be overwritten.

=== Generating ontologies ===

The ontologies file, facebookontology_p.h, can be completed with ontology-writer.py. This tool takes
in input the ontology file as well as a JSON description file, and extracts all the properties 
(except those flagged as not in the ontologies), and write a new section inside the ontology file
containing all the ontology keys for the new class.

If the section containing the keys for the class described in the JSON file already exists, it will
be overwritten. Other sections are not affected.

Usage: ontology-writer.py [-h] ontology_file structure_file
Example: ontology-writer.py facebookontology_p.h cover.json

=== Generating interfaces ===

interface-writer.py can write a the header and source file of an interface, when provided a
description file. If the description file describes only a non-identifiable interface, without
any custom property then the generated files should be complete. 

If custom propeties are involved, or if the interface is identifiable, then the generated
class should be completed, by how the custom properties should be modified, and how the methods
should be implemented.

You should write your implementation inside the minipatcher flags. A rerun of ontology-writer.py, 
with a modified JSON description file, should keep the implementation you already wrote inside
the existing flags.

interface-writer.py may write only one header and a source file or two headers (public and private)
and the source file depending on if the interface is identifiable or not. 

Usage: interface-writer.py [-h] structure_file
Example: interface-writer.py album.json

=== Doc to JSON ===

It is often tedious to convert a fully formatted texte (with backspaces and backslashes) to 
a JSON string. doctojson.py makes that conversion easier. It can be used to convert a qdoc
documentation to JSON strings. 

You should write the documentation inside a plain text file. Running doctojson.py on it
will return it in a one line JSON formatted string.

Usage: doctojson.py [-h] doc_file
Example: doctojson.py album.doc

(Remark: this is a quick hack, and there might be way better methods out there)

== Future work ==

* Add static methods to be implemented for identifiable interface, in order to migrate
  methods from FacebookInterface to each interface.
